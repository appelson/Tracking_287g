BJS released a solicitation in 2013 for a survey of the tribal activities
and caseloads of all State and local law enforcement agencies and all local
prosecutors’ offices that provided services on tribal lands. BJS also
designed a national survey of tribal courts; and it expanded the survey of
jails in Indian country in order to explore other offense types, including
burglary, larceny-theft, and public intoxication. In addition, BJS is
preparing a report that documents the processing of American Indian or
Alaska Native Juvenile and adult cases in the Federal justice system. The
BJS Web site continues to be the central source of Department of Justice
tribal statistics and funding opportunities for improved data reporting in
national record systems. The number of tribal law enforcement agencies that
are reporting crime data in the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program
increased from 143 in 2010 to 168 in 2011. Tribes received $404,317 through
the Bureau of Justice Assistance’s 2013 Edward Byrne Memorial Justice
Assistance Grant (JAG) Program. BJS also announced multiple funding
opportunities in 2013 for improving tribal criminal history records and the
reporting of persons prohibited from receiving or possessing a firearm
under State or Federal law. A figure shows the total JAG allocations to
American Indian tribes for 2008-2013. Another figure shows the total tribal
law enforcement agencies reporting identifiable violent and property crimes
for 2008-2011, and a table presents data on total violent and property
crimes reported by these agencies for each of these years. Previously
released reports on tribal crime data collection activities are listed.
