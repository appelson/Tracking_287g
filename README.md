***Update (July 7th, 2025):** Added a code and [resulting CSV](/agreements.csv) that merges the 287(G) data with agencies in the [Census of State and Local Law Enforcement Agencies (CSLLEA), 2018 (ICPSR 38771)](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/NACJD/studies/38771). This allows us to merge the agency data with agency-centered datasets. Particularly, [`agreements.csv`]((/agreements.csv) contains zipcodes, how many people the law enforcement agency polices, and what their operating budget is.*

***Update (June 16th, 2025):** The `sheets` and `agreement` folders now only contain **new** data/documents to save storage.*

# Tracking 287(g)

This repository downloads data and agreements from the **287(g)** program and organizes them to be used by journalists, advocates, and the public. The scraper runs daily, extracting data from the official [ICE 287(g) page](https://www.ice.gov/identify-and-arrest/287g). The data is saved in two main folders:

- **`agreements/`**: Contains PDFs of all 287(g) agreements between law enforcement agencies and ICE, categorized by download date/time, state, and agency.
- **`sheets/`**: Stores Excel files listing participating and pending agencies, as published on the ICE website, categorized by download date/time.

### *Note*
This project was created in my personal capacity. Should you have any questions or suggestions for other public immigration data you would like to see tracked, you can contact me at elijahappelson@gmail.com.

## Purpose

Law enforcement agencies are increasingly entering into agreements with ICE under the **287(g)** program, assisting in the deportation of immigrants from across the U.S. Between 2016 and June 2024, this facilitated at least 47,000 ICE arrests. This program is supported by mandates like [Louisiana Executive Order Number JML 25-060: Project Geaux](https://interactive.wwltv.com/pdfs/Operation_GEAUX.pdf), which directs state law enforcement agencies to collaborate with ICE.

As mandates like this continue to grow, itâ€™s crucial to track which agencies are involved in the program, especially as the Federal Government continues to make data harder to access. This repository provides a real-time overview of participating agencies and their respective agreements.

### *Note*
The Immigrant Legal Resource Center maintains a [national map](https://www.ilrc.org/practitioners/national-map-287g-agreements) of 287(g) agreements along with resources to  understand them.
